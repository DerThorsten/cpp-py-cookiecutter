# xt-boilerplate
a cookiecutter


* cpp and python in one project
* unit tests with cpp doctest
* benchmark code with google benchmark
* python bindings with xtensor-python / pybind11
* docs with sphinx breathe and readthedocs support
* google benchmark and cpp doctest are downloaded at cmake-config time via external-projects since these dependencies are just for testing and benchmarking
